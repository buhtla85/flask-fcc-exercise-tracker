# flask-fcc-exercise-tracker
FCC Exercise Tracker made in Flask

The idea for this project came from FCC APIs and Microservices Projects (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker), and I thought that it would be fun to build this with Python and Flask.
